/**
 * Routes converted from real outdoor walks, cached on the console.
 *
 * These arrive over MQTT from Home Assistant, which got them from the phone.
 * They are **cached to disk on arrival**, and that is the whole reason this
 * class exists rather than a `@Volatile` field like the one holding the person
 * registry: the console can boot with no network at all. A route fetched at
 * workout time would not be there, and the failure would arrive at the worst
 * possible moment — standing on the belt, having chosen a walk.
 *
 * MQTT retains the topic, so a console that boots *with* a network gets the
 * routes from the broker without Home Assistant needing to be up. The disk copy
 * covers the case where the broker is unreachable too.
 *
 * There is no GPS here and never will be. What arrives is a gradient profile:
 * `[startM, endM, incline]` triples against distance travelled. The phone
 * discards the track before sending — see `iOS.md`.

     * A recorded walk is usually one way — the 30 minutes from the hospital to
     * the front door is a fine walk and a poor workout, because it is over when
     * you have done it once. Turning round is what you would do outdoors, and
     * it is a different walk from going round twice: the hill you climbed on
     * the way out is the hill you come down on the way back, and the flat bit
     * you enjoyed at the start is the drag at the end.
     *
     * So the return leg is the outbound one **reversed and inverted**, not
     * repeated. At `distanceM + x` you are standing where you were at
     * `distanceM - x`, facing the other way, which is exactly what negating the
     * gradient means.
     *
     * Two honest limitations, both the machine's rather than this function's:
     *
     *  * **The deck stops at −3%.** Come back down anything steeper than that
     *    and the descent is clamped, by the same `coerceIn` every route goes
     *    through. A 9% climb on the way out is a 3% descent on the way home.
     *    The ascents are untouched, because nothing outdoors was steeper going
     *    down than the deck can climb going up.
     *  * **Climb is recomputed, not doubled.** Total ascent over an out-and-back
     *    is the outbound ascent plus the outbound *descent*, which for a route
     *    that does not end where it started is not twice anything. It comes out
     *    as the sum of the absolute rise of every segment.
     *
     * Per walk, never stored: the loop button on the picker chooses it for this
     * session and the cached route is untouched.
